# Install AIFM in /home

To reproduce AIFM results  and generate plots we require AIFM to be installed both in compute server and memory server in ```/home```. (eg. ```/home/AIFM```)

If you have set up TrackFM environment already, you do not need to install any packages, OFED. You can directly follow AIFM/Shenango build instructions from https://github.com/AIFM-sys/AIFM starting from ```./build_all.sh```.
